---- About ----

nimrod-geonames is a Nimrod wrapper for the GeoNames API.

See the documentation.html file for documentation, and the offical documentation at http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html for more info on the API.

Note that nimrod-geonames does not yet have procs for all of the GeoNames services, but the core ones are already done.
